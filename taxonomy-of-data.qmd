To learn how to critique and construct claims made using data.

## Data defined

**Data:**

(n) An item of (chiefly numerical) information, esp. one obtained by
    scientific work, a number of which are typically collected together
    for reference, analysis, or calculation.

-   From latin *datum*: that which is given.

-   Facts.

-   **Variable:**

-   A characteristic of an object / unit that can be measured /
    recorded.

**Observations**: the collection of objects / units that are being
measured / recorded.

## Taxonomy

## Types of Variables

**Numerical**:

Variables that take numbers as values that are sensible to add,
subtract, etc.

**Categorical**:

Variables that take categories as values (called *levels*).

**Continuous**:

A numerical variable that takes values on an interval of the real number
line.

**Discrete**:

A numerical variable that takes values that have jumps between them
(i.e. an ordered countable set).

**Ordinal**:

A categorical variable with levels that have a natural ordering.

**Nominal**:

A categorical variable with levels with no ordering.

# The Data Frame

## Observing Penguins

![](images/palmer-station.jpeg)

## Palmer Station, Antarctica

*Size measurements for adult foraging penguins near Palmer Station,
Antarctica*, K. Gorman 2020.

## Variables: Beak Length, Beak Depth

![](images/culmen_depth.png)

> These are *continuous* variables.

## Variable: Species

![](images/lter_penguins.png)

> This is a nominal variable.

## The Data Frame

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  select(bill_depth_mm, bill_length_mm, species) %>%
  sample_n(4) %>%
  kbl()
```

A **data frame** is an array that associates the *observations* (downs
the rows) with the *variables* measured on each observation (across the
columns). Each cell storse a **value** observed for a variable on an
observation.

**Unit of observation**:

The type of the object on which the variables are observed.

> Here: an adult foraging *penguin* near Palmer Station, Antarctica

## Non-tidy Data Frames

From Wikipedia, a *contingency table* of sex and handedness.

![](images/non-tidy-contingency-table.png)

.task\[ What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables? \]

## Non-tidy Data Frames

From the World Bank, the number of hospital beds.

![](images/non-tidy-world-bank.png)

 What is the unit of observation?

What are the variables?

## For next time


1.  Read Ch.1 from Openintro

2.  Download R and RStudio

3.  Practice with RStudio.cloud
