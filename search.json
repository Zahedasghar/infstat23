Students are required to finish computer-based assignments. I wish that you learn stuff in this class in a way learning is fixed and timing will be a variable but due to some regulatory issues, some hybrid model will be followed. Without active engagement, you will not be able to learn well and perform good in the course.\nPre-requisite: Basic Statistics or special approval needed\n\n\nAt the end of this course, the student should be able to:\n\nDefine and summarize research design and data collection principles and concepts.\nCreate and interpret graphical data summaries.\nCalculate and interpret summary statistics.\nCalculate probabilities.\nUnderstand inferential statistics.\nPerform hypothesis tests for numerical and categorical data\nCalculate confidence interval for numerical and categorical data\nANOVA"
